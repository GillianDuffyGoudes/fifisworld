		<p> Hi! I'm Fifi, and welcome to my website. I am a calico housecat based out of Charleston, South Carolina with my family. I have two parents (Gillian and Niko), a brother (Morissey), and THREE sisters!! (Lucy, Ruby, and Opa) My grandma found my mom pregnant mom in her driveway and helped her be able to deliver a healthy birth of me and my littermates. On thanksgiving 2023, Gillian and Niko brought me to Charleston and introduced me to my brother and sisters! They sure were thankful for me LOL! I am a bit shy of strangers but enjoy snuggling with my parents and playing with my siblings. In my spare time, I nap on the bed, nap in the cat tower, steal Gillian's hair ties and try to get Ruby to pick me up in her mouth. Ruby is much bigger than me, she's a Great Dane! Which is great for me, because she answers to my beck and call. This house in Charleston is my world, and I run the show. Use your mouse to hover over pictures of me to learn more about me! Love ya!</p>
